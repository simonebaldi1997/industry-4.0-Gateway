# industry-4.0-Gateway

This repository was created to make available the files of a master's thesis in computer engineering titled "Development and evaluation of a secure gateway for industry 4.0 applications". It includes the docker-compose.yml file, which is used to create the execution environment of the architecture with the two containers. The start.sh file is useful for launching the commands described in the thesis via bash files in Linux. Finally, socketClient and socketServer are present, which represent the Java application that was used to simulate the traffic between the two networks.
